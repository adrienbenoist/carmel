The Carmel Token Distribution Model has changed over the course of 2018 as we've learned more about the market and as we've entered a Post-ICO era that has seen significant changes to the way Blockchain Projects are - and should be - funded. As such, we've updated our Token Distribution Model with what we consider to be an ideal way of initiating a healthy digital economy.

There is a total supply of **7,000,000,000 Carmel Tokens** of which **20%** are reserved for founders in a **Founders Fund**, **10%** for partners in a **Partners Fund** and **10%** are used for community growth, including bounties, rewards, prizes, scholarships and incentives in a **Fluid Fund**. A total of **50%** of the entire supply is going to be distributed as an EOS ShareDrop 3.5 CARMEL for every EOS, by the end of 2018. The remaining **10%** of the tokens will be sold before listing the token on exchanges and will also be used in AirDrops and Beta Bounties.

Undistributed tokens are placed in the Fluid Fund. No tokens are burned and no new tokens are created during the distribution campaign. New tokens will be generated daily at a fixed inflation rate of 5% per year and added to the Fluid Fund, starting on Day 1 of the official launch of the Carmel Platform, after the token distribution period ends.

## EOS ShareDrop

A total of **3,500,000,000 Carmel Tokens** will be distributed to all EOS token holders before the end of 2018, on a 3.5:1 ratio. This allows us to place half of the economy in the hands of those who already own EOS tokens and who have a stake in the EOS Ecosystem and it also always us to have a wide distribution as early as possible before listing on exchanges.

## Early Token Holdings Adjustments

More than 50,000 people own Carmel Tokens from early distribution rounds. To account for the **x100** increase in supply without diluting the overall cap, we will update all wallets accordingly (x100) before the end of the year.

## Listing On Exchanges

The Carmel Token will start listing on exchanges before the end of 2018 and will continue listing on more exchanged during Q1 2019.

## Pre-Listing Token Sale

A small portion of tokens are available for purchase before the listing begins, in order to seed the initial development efforts.
